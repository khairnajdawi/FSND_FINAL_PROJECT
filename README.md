## Project Parts

1. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
2. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

## About the Stack

To start the full stack application, just follow the instruction in both frontend and backend, starting at backend.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module to simplify your data needs. You will need configure, and integrate Auth0 for authentication, and change the DATABASE_URL in setup.sh.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will only need to update the environment variables to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app. 

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
